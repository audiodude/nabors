Indexes to the earlier volumes of the debates are poor,
necessitating almost page by page examination. To avoid this
process, the index to the Senate and House Journals may be used,
checking the table of bills in the Journals which refers to the
pages where the bill was considered by Congress. This leads to
the dates when Congress acted on the bill and then those dates
can be checked in the volume of debates listed below:

Annals of Congress 1st Cong. to 18th 1780—1824
(Sometimes cited as Cong. lst Sess.
History of Congress)
Register of Debates 18th Cong., 2d Sess., to 1824—1837*
