Indexes to the earlier volumes of the debates are poor,
necessitating almost page by page examination. To avoid this
process, the index to the Senate and House Journals may be used,
checking the table of bills in the Journals which refers to the
pages where the bill was considered by Congress. This leads to
the dates when Congress acted on the bill and then those dates
can be checked in the volume of debates listed below:

* Annals of Congress (Sometimes cited as History of Congress)  
1st Cong. to 18th Cong. lst Sess.  
1780—1824 

* Register of Debates  
18th Cong., 2d Sess., to 25th Cong., 1st Sess.  
1824—1837*

* Congressional Globe  
23d Cong., 1st Sess., to 42d Cong., 2d Sess.  
1833—1873*

* Congressional Record  
43d Cong., 1st Sess., to  
1873—

*Note that both the Register of Debates and the Congressional
Globe cover the years 1833—1837.
