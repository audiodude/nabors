Introduction
============

This key is intended to provide a systematic reference to
the numbers of the U.S. Congressional bills and joint
resolutions which became law from the 1st Congress (1789)
through the 57th Congress (1903). The number assigned to a bill
when introduced in the Congress provides the most direct
historical reference for tracing legislative history. It should
be noted that by its very nature this study is tabular in form
with annotations and explanation whenever necessary.

No legislative bill numbers were used in the Statutes at
Large prior to March 3, 1903. With the exception of the date,
which always has been used, the only identifiers given the laws
in the Statutes at Large were the chapter numbers. These were
assigned in one sequence to all laws upon receipt and the
numbering was started anew each session. Therefore, when the
two categories — public and private — were classified and
separated for publication in the Statutes at Large, discontinuity
occurred in the number sequence of each. Since this
checklist includes only public laws you will find breaks in the
numbering sequence of the Chapters caused by the omission of the
private laws.

The line of demarcation to determine the private and public
laws is not easily defined until the publication of the Statutes
at Large was transferred to the General Services Administration
by Reorganization Plan No. 20. (Federal Register, Volume 15,
Number 101, May 25, 1950, p. 3178).

Prior to 1950 no rules determined the division of laws into
private or public acts. There are, however, certain considerations
which have been followed in order to determine the class
into which a law should be placed. In arriving at the conclusion,
an act was always examined and considered as a unit,
rather than paragraph by paragraph, in order to identify the
intent of Congress when the act was passed. That determination
was based upon the debate of the legislation as it appeared in
the Congressional Record; the nature of the legislation; its
effect and scope; whether it amended previous classed
legislation; and upon personal opinion.

Legislation classed generally as public may be listed as
that in which the interest of the government are paramount,
particular, or outweighs the other considerations of the act
and/or the interest of the public as a whole is affected.
Legislation classed generally as private may be stated to
include that which is passed for the particular benefit of an
individual or group of individuals, in the enactment of which
the government of public has no direct or immediate interest.
In borderline cases the general practice is to classify the law
as public; that is the present practice of the General Services
Administration.

Even though the assignment of numbers of bills is extremely
important in tracing their legislative histories, "The numbering
of bills apparently started during the 15th Congress. It seems
that beginning with the congress House bills were numbered
continuously through a congress, and remained alive beyond the
first session. Until the 30th Congress, Senate bills were
numbered beginning with 1 for each session and appear to have
died at the end of the session". (1)

While the House, in 1817, adopted the policy of numbering
the bills consecutively, it was not until 1847 that the Senate
began using the same numbering system as in the House and some
uniformity achieved. However, the key identifier, the bill
number was not included in the U.S. Statutes at Large along with
the chapter number, brief title/synopses, and approval date of
law. Bill numbers were (and are) important to the committees
and the Members of Congress because they consider, report, and
debate the bills primarily on basis of the assigned number. In
the absence of bill numbers assigned at the time of introduction,
searchers must rely upon other sources and identifiers. However,
the House and Senate Journals, which are the only official
record of Congressional activity required by the Constitution,
are excellent sources for tracing legislative histories,
especially for the period from 1789 to 1903. These were the
sources used in compiling this checklist.

The House and Senate Journals are also excellent supplementary
tools to be used with the Indexes to the debates as
explained in the "Users Guide" to this checklist.

The difficulties, caused by the omission of bill numbers
prior to 1903, have been recognized by those interested in
developing histories for academic, legislative or judicial
reason. Each legislative history had to be developed on a case
by case basis, there being no overall finding list which could
be used. Hence, this publication should create a significant and
expedient source for beginning legislative research for the
period covered, making it possible for librarians and re-
searchers in the legal community to save a significant amount
of time.

Legislative histories can be essential to any individualwho
needs to understand the statutory intent and meaning of the law.
