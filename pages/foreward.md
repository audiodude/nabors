Foreword

For the legislative historian, now conditioned to the
existence of convenient means of tracing U.S. legislative history
from current Congressional calendars, many official catalogs or
the almost countless checklists and services that have been
published over the past 25 years, it seems scarcely credible
that 32 volumes of the U.S. Statutes at Large, published from
1789 to 1903, contained no references to statutory bill numbers"
an essential element in identifying the progress of legislation.
Now that Congress can routinely introduce as many as 30,000
pieces of legislation in a two—year session, the bill number has
assumed great significance as the usual means of tracking current
status into law. I

But for the historian seeking a description of legislative
intent for laws enacted during the first century of the
Republic, the search heretofore has been initially impeded
because there was no reference in the statute books to bill
numbers even if the searcher had access to early bill prints.
Not only is there a dearth of documentation to describe intent
before 1900, but there has been nothing to assist with this
basic process of numerical identification even if the public
law or chapter number of the legislation was known. As this
checklist will reveal, bill numbers for this early period could
be obtained only by tedious and generally inconvenient reference
to the official Journals of the proceedings of the Senate and
House of Representatives. Having now checked all of these
reference for us from these journals and other little—noticed
sources, Mr. Nabors makes a fundamental contribution to the job
of researching legislation enacted from 1789 to 1903.

This work was very much inspired by necessity and by its
author's fortunate proximity to an incomparable collection of
legislation and Congressional records of proceedings in the
American-British Law Division of the Library of Congress.

Mr. Nabors has been one of the principal managers of this
collection for many years and for those who approach it, a
mentor with singular knowledge of its organization and function.
For those of us who have been privileged to know him in
Washington, this knowledge has on countless occasions expedited
"trips to the Hill" that could have otherwise consumed days.
His patience and conscientious concern to assist a truly
enormous public through a maze of documents that describe
nothing less than the evolution of American government, are
personal qualities that made this checklist finally possible.
It has been at least ten years in preparation. The time that
it will now save historians, librarians and archivists probably
cannot be measured.
